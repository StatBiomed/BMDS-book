## Exercises

This list of exercises will serve as a 2-hour demonstration in the BIOF1001 course. 
For other learners, you can go through it as homework. The expected time is 
around two hours if you have read the R materials carefully together with
trying them with your own R environment.

> __Note__, before you get started, please make sure that you are familiar with
the panels in RStudio. You may watch this 
[YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIrsOBy5k58) or check this 
[RStudio cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf).

### Part 1. Basics (~40min) { #exercises-p1 }

* Q1: We have 25 students in BIOF1001, to store the final marks (0 to 100 with 
a precision of 0.1), what data type will we use?

<!-- > Numeric (or float or double) -->

* Q2: For the grades (`A+` to `F`), what data type and data structure can be 
used to keep the memory minimal?

<!-- > `character` and `factor` -->

* Q3: Make a matrix with name `my_matrix`, shape of 5 rows and 2 columns and values 
from 3 to 12. The first row is 3 and 4. 
*Hint*: for making a vector from 3 to 12, you may use `seq()` or `:`.

<!-- > my_matrix = matrix(seq(3, 12), nrow=5, byrow=TRUE) -->
<!-- > my_matrix = matrix(3:12, nrow=5, byrow=TRUE) -->

* Q4: Based on `Q3`, add the row names to `Day1` to `Day5` and column names to
`Lunch` and `Dinner`.

<!-- > rownames(my_matrix) = c("Day1", "Day2", "Day3", "Day4", "Day5") -->
<!-- > colnames(my_matrix) = c("Lunch", "Dinner") -->
<!-- > rownames(my_matrix) = paste0("Day", seq(1,5)) -->

* Q5: Based on `Q4`, get a matrix with shape of 3x1 and values of 6, 8, 10 from 
the matrix `my_matrix`.

<!-- > Any of the following codes: -->
<!-- > my_matrix[2:4, 2, drop=FALSE] -->
<!-- > my_matrix[c(2, 3, 4), 2, drop=FALSE] -->
<!-- > my_matrix[c("Day2", "Day3", "Day4"), 2, drop=FALSE] -->

* Q6: What will you get for `my_matrix[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE), ]`? 
*Hint*: think of recycling if the index length is different from the query 
dimension (Over-flexibility comes with a price of wrong use).

<!-- > it will give row length of 3, for row 1, 4 and 5. -->

* Q7: If you have two vectors the BIOF1001 `marks` and `grades` and one 
`character` for teaching performance `"good"`, and you want to store them 
into one variable, which data structure will you use? 

<!-- > `list` data structure -->

* Q8: Now, on your `Desktop folder`, make a subfolder with name `R_exercises`
and download this file of differentailly expressed genes results
[Diff_Expression_results.tsv](https://github.com/StatBiomed/BMDS-book/blob/main/notebooks/chapter1-R/Diff_Expression_results.tsv) 
to the folder. Check your current work directory by
`getwd()` function and change the work directory to the folder you just created.
*Hint*: you may use `setwd()` to change the work directory or use the `Session` 
button of RStudio.


* Q9: Related to Q8, use the `read.table()` function to load the file into a 
data frame with the variable name `df_DEG`.
*Hint*: You may consider using the full path or just the file name if it's in 
the same work directory. Please keep `header=TRUE` for the argument. Think how to
find help page for a certain function.

<!-- > df_DEG = read.table("Diff_Expression_results.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE) -->

* Q10: Can you calculate the `mean` and `standard deviation` of the `log2FoldChange`?
If the mean >0.1 and the standard deviation < 3, set the `trend` variable as 
"increase", otherwise "not_increase". What will happen if you add this `trend` 
variable to the data frame, and why?
*Hint*: use `mean()` and `st()` functions for calculating mean and 
standard deviation.

<!-- > trend = "not_increase" -->
<!-- > if (mean(df_DEG$log2FoldChange) > 0.1 && sd(df_DEG$log2FoldChange) < 3) trend = "increase" -->
<!-- > df_DEG[["trend"]] = trend -->
<!-- > data frame is also a list -->




### Part 2. Making plotting (~40min) { #exercises-p2 }

* Q11: Keep use the `df_DEG` from part 1 Q9. Now, make a histogram of the 
`log2FoldChange` with both basic plotting function `hist()` and `ggplot2`.


* Q12: Make a plot with x-axis of `log10(baseMean)` and y-axis of `log2FoldChange`.
Please try both the basic `plot()` function and `ggplot2`.

* Q13: Now, manipulate the dataframe by adding two columns:
  - Add a column `log2FC_clip` for clipping log2FoldChange to `[-5, +5]`
  - Add a column `is_DE` for `padj < 0.05`

* Q14: Try the `summary()` function with the above `df_DEG` data frame, and also
`table()` function for the `is_DE` column.

* Q15: Based on ggplot2, add the color by the newly added column `is_DE`.

<!-- ggplot(df, aes(x=log10(baseMean), 	   	     y=log2FoldChange_clip)) +  -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(color=is_DE)) +  -->
<!--   scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "grey")) -->

* Q16: Set the colors to "red" and "grey", and make it in the order of TRUE and 
FALSE. 
*Hint*: use `factor` and set the `levels` parameter.

* Q17: Save the generated figure into "My_DEG_results.pdf". Use the 
[ggsave()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html) function. Please
set `width = 5, height = 4`.

You are expected a figure like this

![DEG figure](https://github.com/StatBiomed/BMDS-book/raw/main/notebooks/chapter1-R/DEG_results.png)

If you want to change labels on x-axis or y-axis and font size, etc., you can 
simply Google and find examples.



### Part 3. For loop and repeating processing (~40min)  { #exercises-p3 }

* Q18: Load the following table from this file on GitHub and *View* it in RStudio.

  It contains expressoon of 619 transcription factors from 7 Nasopharyngeal 
  carcinoma (NPC) samples and 3 nasopharyngeal lymphatic hyperplasia (NLH) samples.
  https://github.com/StatBiomed/NegabinGLM/blob/main/data/NPC_NLH-Tcell-donorX.tsv

  `df_NPC = read.table("https://github.com/StatBiomed/NegabinGLM/raw/main/data/NPC_NLH-Tcell-donorX.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)`


* Q19: Extract the column 5 (HES5) to 623 (LEK4) and make it into a matrix `TF_mat`
*Hint*: how to index a data frame like index a matrix.

<!-- > TF_mat = as.matrix(df_NPC[, colnames(df_NPC)[5:623]]) -->
<!-- > TF_mat = as.matrix(df_NPC[, 5:623]) -->

* Q20: perform normalization. Divide the `TF_mat` by the `df_NPC$total_counts`
  and multiply by 1000000, and assign it to a new matrix named `TF_mat_norm`. 

  You may further consider transformation by log1p(), i.e., log(TF_mat_norm + 1).

* Q21: calculate the log fold change on the first gene TP73 in `TF_mat_norm` 
between NPC (row 1 to 7) and NLH (row 8 to 10) and perform t-test return the 
`p` value and log fold change.

* Q22: perform t-test on the *all* gene in `TF_mat_norm` between 
NPC (row 1 to 7) and NLH (row 8 to 10).
*Hint*: think of for loop or `apply()` function.
