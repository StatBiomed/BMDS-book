This book is designed as a collection of R Markdown notebooks, as supplementary 
to the lecture notes for the course 
[BIOF1001: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science](),
an undergraduate course (Year 1) at the University of Hong Kong.

**Note:** Most contents may be only updated before or right after the lectures, 
so please refer to the updated version.
