# Appendix A: Install R & RStudio {#install - }

This manual covers the installation of both R and RStudio for three different 
operating systems: Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. You only need to follow the one 
that you are using on your computer.

**Difference between R and RStudio**

* R is the backbone of R programming. Once R is installed, you can use it 
  via its build-in `R Console` (self-contained), terminal or any third-party
  integrated development environment (IDE), e.g., RStudio.
  
* RStudio is a multi-facet and user-friendly IDE that can make R programming and 
  data analysis in one place and easy to manage. We recommend using RStudio 
  and only demonstrate with it, while you are free to use any other alternative.

by Xiunan Fang and other team members in Dr Joshua Ho's lab.


## A.1 Install R {-}

### R on Windows {-}
- Open an internet browser and go to https://cran.r-project.org/.
- Click on the ``Download R for Windows`` link at the top of the page.
- Choose the ``base`` and then Click on the ``Download R 4.2.1 for Windows``
  link at the top of the page (or a new version if this manual is outdated).
- Once the download is finished, you will obtain a file named 
  ``R-4.2.1-win.exe`` or similar depending on the version that you download.
- Most of the time, you will likely want to go with the defaults, so click the 
  button ``Next`` until the process is complete.

### R on macOS {-}
- Open an internet browser and go to https://cran.r-project.org/.
- Click on the ``Download R for macOS`` link at the top of the page.
- Click on the file containing the latest version of R under the 
  **Latest release**.
- Save the ``.pkg`` file, double-click it to open, and follow the installation 
  instructions. 
  **Note**, there are two versions of the .pkg installation file according to 
  the CPU model: Intel Macs (Intel-based) or M1 Macs (ARM-based). 
  **Please choose accordingly**.

### R on Ubuntu {-}

As it is common, prior to installing R, let us update the system package index 
and upgrade all our installed packages using the following two commands:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade
```

After that, all that you have to do is run the following in the command line to 
install base R.
```
sudo apt -y install r-base
```



## A.2 Install RStudio {-}

Now that R is installed, you need to download and install RStudio.
It is more straightforward to install RStudio and very similar across the three 
OS. 

- Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. We are 
  using ```RStudio Desktop`` **Free** version.
- Click on the right file for your OS (e.g., `.exe` file for Windows)
- The installation process is very straightforward as the figure below.

## A.3 Use R inside RStudio {-}
### R studio {-}
RStudio is very powerful for providing a four-pane workspace.

* Top-left panel: Your scripts of the R codes, script is good to keep a record 
  of your work and also convenient for command execution.

  You can create a new script by `` File –> New –> R Script``

* Bottom-left panel: R console for R commands, where you actually run the R 
  codes.

* Top-right panel: Workspace tab: All the data(more specifically, R objects) 
  you have created in the ``Workspace`` and all previous commands you 
  previously ran in the ``History``.

* Bottom-right panel: Files in your working directory(you probably should also 
  set your working directory) in ``Files``, and the plots you have created in 
  ``Plots``.

### Set working directory {-}
-  Create a folder named “biof_Rdir” in your preferred directory
-  Create a "data" folder in the "biof_Rdir"
-  From RStudio, use the menu to change your working directory under
``Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory``
-  Choose the directory to “biof_Rdir”

![](./images/directory.png){width=65%}

Or you can type in the console:
```
setwd("/yourdirectory/biof_Rdir")
```
For Windows, the command might look like :
```
setwd("c:/yourdirectory/biof_Rdir")
```

### Some general knowledge {-}
- R is case-sensitive
- Type enter to run R code in the console pane
- Ctrl-enter or Cmd-return if the code is in the scripts pane.
- Comments come after # will not be treated as codes
- R has some pre-loaded data sets, to see the list of pre-loaded data, type 
  ``data()``
- In R, a function is an object, a basic syntax of an R function looks like 
  something below:
```
function_name <- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) {
   actual function codes
}
```

For example:
```{r}
my_average <- function(x){
  sum(x)/length(x)
}

my_average(c(1, 4, 5, 7))
```

R contains a lot of built-in functions, you can use ``?`` to see the 
documentation of a function, there are also a lot of external libraries with 
specific functions. To use a library, we do:
```
install.packages('package_name')
library(package_name)
```

### Install packages {-}
There are several packages used in this workshop, in the R console, type:
```
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('pheatmap')
install.packages('aod')
```

## A4. Cloud computing {-}
In case you have limited computing power, you can still use cloud computing to 
finish this course. There can be multiple options and here we mainly recommend
RStudio cloud (https://rstudio.cloud). You can explore directly from their 
website.
