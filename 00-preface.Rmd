# Preface {-}

This book is designed as the lecture notes and textbook for 
[BIOF1001: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science](),
an undergraduate course (Year 1) at the University of Hong Kong.

This book is not aimed to be a comprehensive textbook, but rather more 
Rmarkdown notebooks as supplementary to lecture notes so that students can 
reproduce the teaching contents more easily.

## Introduction for readers {-}

### What we hope you will learn from this course / book {-}
In part I, you will find a general introduction to data science (by Dr YH Huang):

1) Quantitative methods: t-test, correlation analysis, clustering, linear 
   regression, linear classification.
2) Basic programming and visualisation skills: R scripts for the above methods 
   and data visualisation.
3) Gain familiarity with common databases in the biomedical domain. 
4) Introduce ethical, legal, social and technological issues related to 
   biomedical data sciences.
5) Introduce good practice in managing a data science project and communicate 
   results to key stakeholders.

In part II, you will experience data types in five different biomedical topics,
which will be illustrated with both introduction and cases that are suitable for
problem-based learning format:

1) Personalised genomic medicine, by Dr David Shih and Dr Yuanhua Huang
2) Medical imaging and digital health, by Dr Joshua Ho and Dr Lequan Yu
3) Infectious disease informatics, by Dr Tommy Lam and Dr Kathy Leung
4) Population genetics and diseases, by Dr Clara Tang and Dr Asif Javed
5) Epidemiology of cancer and other diseases, by Dr Jason Wong and Dr Carlos Wong


### What we recommend you do while reading this book {-}
To enhance the knowledge and skills learned from this book, we recommend the
readers

1) Read materials/slides provided in each module
2) Practice quantitative skills by solving problems using R
