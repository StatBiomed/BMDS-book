# Preface {-}

This book is designed as the supporting textbook for 
[BIOF1001: Introduction to Biomedical Data Science](),
an undergraduate course (Year 1) at the University of Hong Kong.

This book is not aimed to be a comprehensive textbook, but rather more 
Rmarkdown notebooks as supplementary to lecture notes so that students can 
reproduce the teaching contents more easily.

## Introduction for readers {-}

### What you will learn from this course/book {-}
In part I, you will find a general introduction to data science (by 
Dr Jason Wong, Dr Ray Hsu, and Dr Yuanhua Huang):

2) Basic programming and visualisation skills: R scripts for the quantitative 
   methods and data visualisation.
1) Quantitative methods: t-test, correlation analysis, clustering, linear 
   regression, linear classification.
3) Gain familiarity with common databases in the biomedical domain. 
4) Introduce ethical, legal, social and technological issues related to 
   biomedical data sciences.
5) Introduce good practice in managing a data science project and communicate 
   results to key stakeholders.

In part II, you will experience data types in four different biomedical topics,
which will be illustrated with both introduction and cases that are suitable for
problem-based learning format:

1) Medical imaging and digital health, by Dr Joshua Ho and Dr Eden Ti
2) Cancer genomics, by Dr David Shih
3) Epidemiology, by Dr Kathy Leung
4) Population genetics, by Dr Clara Tang

### What we recommend you do while reading this book {-}
To enhance the knowledge and skills learned from this book, we recommend that
readers

1) Read the materials/slides provided in each module
2) Practice quantitative skills by solving problems using R

## Other reference books {-}
